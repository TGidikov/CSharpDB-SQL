9. Age Groups
Write down a query that creates 7 different groups based on their age.
Age groups should be as follows:
•	[0-10]
•	[11-20]
•	[21-30]
•	[31-40]
•	[41-50]
•	[51-60]
•	[61+]
The query should return

11. Average Interest 
Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability. He wants to know the average interest of all deposit groups split by whether the deposit has expired or not. But that’s not all. He wants you to select deposits with start date after 01/01/1985. Order the data descending by Deposit Group and ascending by Expiration Flag.
The output should consist of the following columns:
Example:
DepositGroup	IsDepositExpired	AverageInterest
Venomous Tongue	0	16.698947
…	…	

12. * Rich Wizard, Poor Wizard
Mr. Bodrog definitely likes his werewolves more than you. This is your last chance to survive! Give him some data to play his favorite game Rich Wizard, Poor Wizard. The rules are simple: You compare the deposits of every wizard with the wizard after him. If a wizard is the last one in the database, simply ignore it. In the end you have to sum the difference between the deposits.
Host Wizard	Host Wizard Deposit	Guest Wizard	Guest Wizard Deposit	Difference
Harry	10 000	Tom	12 000	-2000
Tom	12 000	…	…	…
At the end your query should return a single value: the SUM of all differences.
Example:
SumDifference
44393.97
