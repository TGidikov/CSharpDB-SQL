This document defines the exercise assignments for the "Databases Basics - MSSQL" course @ Software University. 

1.	Queries for SoftUni Database

1.	Employees with Salary Above 35000
Create stored procedure usp_GetEmployeesSalaryAbove35000 that returns all employees’ first and last names for whose salary is above 35000.

4.	Employees from Town

13500.00	Low
43300.00	Average
125500.00	High

6.	Employees by Salary Level
Write a stored procedure usp_EmployeesBySalaryLevel that receive as parameter level of salary (low, average or high) and print the names of all employees that have given level of salary. You should use the function - "dbo.ufn_GetSalaryLevel(@Salary) ", which was part of the previous task, inside your "CREATE PROCEDURE …" query.
Example
Here is the list of all employees with high salary.
First Name	Last Name
Terri	Duffy
Jean	Trenary
Ken	Sanchez
…	…

7.	Define Function

oistmiahf	Sofia	1
oistmiahf	halves	0

8.	* Delete Employees and Departments
Write a procedure with the name usp_DeleteEmployeesFromDepartment (@departmentId INT) which deletes all Employees from a given department. Delete these departments from the Departments table too. Finally SELECT the number of employees from the given department. If the delete statements are correct the select query should return 0.
After completing that exercise restore your database to revert all changes.
Hint:
You may set ManagerID column in Departments table to nullable (using query "ALTER TABLE …").
